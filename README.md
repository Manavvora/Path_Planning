# Path_Planning
This repository contains python implementation of various path planning algorithms. The main aim of these algorithms is to find the optimal path (shortest in length) from a specified start point to a goal point while avoiding various obstacles present in the enivronment. It is still a work in progress and currently contains implementations of the following algorithms:
1. Djikstra
2. RRT for point mass
3. RRT for Dubins car
4. RRT Star for point mass
5. RRT Star for Dubins car
6. AStar algorithm
7. Potential Field planner
